At the moment our config is very basic and only focuses on our performance with the stable
input of cps (clicks per second) which is around 1.3k-2.3k depending on your pc and your frame limit will not drop as much as other macros 
meaning this is great for low performance pc's but if you do have a high performance pc 
the macro will be UNBEATABLE! Auto Wizard is a toggle based macro meaning when the keybind "1" is pressed
the macro with execute and when let go it will be turned off until toggled again.
